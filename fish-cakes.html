     <h3>These homemade baked or air fried fish cakes are healthier than deep frying.</h3>
      <p>This recipe includes directions for both air frying or baking in the oven, but they do turn out crispier on the air fryer. Fish cakes are a greta way to incorperate protein and healthy fats while delivering a great taste! </p>
      <p>You can make variations to this meal that will keep it exciting and unique each time. If you don't have seasoned panko, you could try onion & garlic powder, dried parsley, salt, and paprika. If you don't like mayo, try greek yogurt! You could swap parsley with dill, tarragon, or basil.</p>
