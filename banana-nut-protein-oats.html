        <h3>This easy to make bowl of oatmeal elevates your morning from being bland and boring to eaxciting and healthy!</h3>
          <p>Oats are a great way to keep fiber in your diet regularly and start your day off feeling full. What's even better than that, is having oats that are packed full of protein that taste great. This bowl requires little time and even fewer ingredients. With 20 grams of protein and 333 calories, this dish will leave you feeling great about your morning. </p>
          <p>While youre making this recipe, be aware that you can switch out some ingredients if you'd like. If vanilla protein powder just doesn't sound appealing, try chocolate! Or if you dont like protein powder, you can feel free to use milk instead (although the protein count will likely be less). You may also like to switch out the pecans for walnuts, or the maple syrup for agave or honey. There are so many different ways to mix up this bowl, you could keep it exciting for a long time to come.</p>
